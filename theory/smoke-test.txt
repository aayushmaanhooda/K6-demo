SMOKE TEST (First)
Purpose: Quick sanity check - does it work at all?
A shakeout test, sometimes known as a smoke test, is a small test that checks for major issues before spending more time and resources. It typically uses one or a few VUs that run for a short amount of time


If smoke test fails → Fix issues before moving forward!

CODE ----------------------------------------------------

// 1-smoke-test.js
import http from 'k6/http';

export const options = {
    vus: 1,           // Only 1 user
    duration: '30s',  // Very short duration
    thresholds: {
        http_req_duration: ['p(95)<1000'],  // Basic threshold
        http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1'],
    }
};

export default function () {
    http.get('https://your-api.com/endpoint');
}
