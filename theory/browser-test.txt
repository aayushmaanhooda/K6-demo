Browser Testing 

The browser module brings browser automation and end-to-end testing to k6 while 
supporting core k6 features.

It adds browser-level APIs to interact with browsers and collect frontend performance 
metrics as part of your k6 tests. 

What it tests:

Frontend/UI performance 
User interactions (click, type, scroll) 
Page load time 
JavaScript rendering
