STRESS TEST (Third)

Purpose: Push beyond normal - find the breaking point
Stress testing assesses how the system performs when loads are heavier than usual. Note: Run stress tests only after smoke and average-load tests. Running this test type earlier may be wasteful and make it hard to pinpoint problems if they appear at low volumes or at loads under the average utilization.

Stress testing is a type of load testing where you gradually increase the load on your system until it breaks or fails, to find its breaking point or limit.
The goal is to answer: "At what point does my system crash or become unusable?"

How It Works
You start with normal load and keep increasing the number of virtual users until:

Response times become unacceptable
Errors start happening
The system crashes or becomes unavailable
CPU/Memory maxes out
